sudo nano /var/www/html/testdb.php

    Add the following code to connect to the database:

<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "yourpassword";  // Replace with your MySQL root password
$dbname = "mydatabase";  // The database you created earlier

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
  die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully to the database!";
?>

    Save and close the file.

7. Test the PHP-MySQL Connection

Now, visit http://localhost/testdb.php in your browser. If everything is set up correctly, you should see "Connected successfully to the database!"
Troubleshooting

    If Apache isn't running, restart it: sudo systemctl restart apache2.
    If MySQL isn't running, restart it: sudo systemctl restart mysql.

In MySQL, by default, there isn’t a password set for the root user on a fresh installation (especially in older versions). However, this behavior may vary depending on the version of MySQL or MariaDB you’re using. Here are some common situations and solutions:
1. MySQL Root User with No Password

If MySQL allows access without a password, you can configure one for the root user. Try logging in as the root user without a password:

sudo mysql -u root

If that works, you can set a password for the root user with the following steps:

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'yourpassword';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Replace 'yourpassword' with a secure password. This command will set a password for the root account, making it more secure and allowing PHP to authenticate.
2. MySQL with auth_socket Plugin

On some systems, MySQL is configured to use the auth_socket plugin, which allows root to log in only via the command line without a password. If this is the case, you won’t be able to connect as root from PHP. To fix this, switch the root authentication method to mysql_native_password:

    Log in to MySQL:

sudo mysql -u root

Change the authentication method:

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'yourpassword';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Exit MySQL:

    EXIT;

Now, you should be able to connect to MySQL using the root user and the new password from PHP.
3. Creating a New User for PHP Access

For security reasons, it's a good idea to create a new MySQL user for PHP applications rather than using root. Here’s how to create a new user:

    Log in to MySQL:

sudo mysql -u root -p

Create a new user and grant privileges:

CREATE USER 'phpuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'phpuserpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'phpuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Use this new user (phpuser) in your PHP script to connect to the database instead of root. Update the credentials in your PHP code:

    $servername = "localhost";
    $username = "phpuser";
    $password = "phpuserpassword";
    $dbname = "mydatabase";

After making these changes, try connecting from PHP again.
